# {{ page.subtitle }}

Any vision planning for youth services must start with an overview of the entire library. You will need your manager’s and director’s buy-in to allow you to take the time and effort to implement connected learning programs, so start by thinking about your library’s mission and strategic goals. Hopefully, your library has a strategic planning document where the vision is described in detail; if not, try to articulate this yourself based on what your director and manager have said and done in the past. Even if you do have a document to reference, you may wish to have a conversation with one or both of them to fully understand their vision for youth services.
