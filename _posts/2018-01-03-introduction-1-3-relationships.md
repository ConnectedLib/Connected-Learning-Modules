> “Watching the teens find each other and connect with each other and realize,’Oh, I'm not the only geek on the planet, and there are other people that are really into stuff in an intense way and that's okay and we can celebrate it’...Our writing club did fairytale fanfiction all summer and it was awesome to see how they bonded and got more comfortable sharing their geek with each other... Connecting the teens to each other is [a] huge success.” -- Suburban Northeast Library

When learning is supported by relationships, teens aren’t just learning with each other—they’re also learning from each other by sharing their ideas, providing constructive feedback, and collaborating on projects.

* Teens collaborate, share projects and activities, and give constructive feedback to each other
