How is literacy defined and what role can librarians play in promoting literacy development? In this section, we present research and theories addressing the impact of digital media technologies on literacy development. Finally, we consider the ways youth librarians are using digital media and technology to support teens’ and young adults’ literacy development.   

Treating young people as digital natives may be doing them a disservice.28 Instead of assuming youth are all technologically savvy in all ways, try to understand teens’ information behavior needs and practices within a developmental context. While technology is a large part of many teens’ everyday lives, their use, skills, and abilities differ.  

WHAT IS LITERACY?  

Literacy is complex concept. Researchers and educators define literacy in various ways. In the digital age, the term includes a wide range of skills beyond reading and writing, including using devices like e-readers and tablets, interpreting information found online, or creating and sharing on digital platforms like YouTube. The notion of literacy has evolved from focusing on reading and writing skills, to embracing a holistic set of skills needed by young people to learn, interact, work, and participate in everyday life (Snow, 2006).  

WHAT NEW LITERACIES HAVE FORMED IN THE DIGITAL AGE?  

Catherine Snow (2004), an expert on literacy and language development, has found that there are varied ways of approaching literacy, including a componential vs. holistic view. For young children, part of literacy development includes building component reading skills such as phonological awareness and letter knowledge. For teens and young adults, many educators focus on a holistic view, or “whole person” approach, to literacy development. As teens and young adults increasingly master component reading skills, a holistic view would focus on the forming connections and meaning through reading and writing. 

For instance, young people are encouraged to bring their own lived experiences to stories, literature, reading, and writing. Through a holistic lens, a young person who informally contributes to gaming websites, writes on discussion boards, or keeps a journal is actively developing emerging literacy skills. Further, a holistic view might examine the social and environmental factors that contribute to literacy development. For example, inequitable distribution of resources (e.g. lack of funding in schools, uninvolved parents) would be a source of risk. Youth librarians can play a central role in encouraging literacy development by participating in activities like sharing titles of a teens’ favorite genres of books, obtaining information about the young person’s interests, or understanding their values concerning books, literature, and learning. 

NEW MEDIA LITERACIES 

From writing fan fiction to following Tumblr blogs to creating their own vlogs, the impact of digital media technologies on literacy development is an important area of research. Scholars have continually promoted the critical new media literacies needed for successful participation in 21st century.  

Henry Jenkins, a prominent media scholar, spearheaded a 2006 white paper, Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century, to build the foundation for a new media literacy movement. Within this seminal work, Jenkins and his coauthors outline a set of cultural competencies and social skills that young people need to acquire if they are going to participate meaningfully in a future digital society. Jenkins calls this future a “participatory culture” that emphasizes collaboration and networking. Among the key social skills and cultural competencies needed to fully participate are: 

Play — the capacity to experiment with one’s surroundings as a form of problem-solving 

Performance — the ability to adopt alternative identities for the purpose of improvisation 

and discovery 

Simulation — the ability to interpret and construct dynamic models of real-world processes 

Appropriation — the ability to meaningfully sample and remix media content 

Multitasking — the ability to scan one’s environment and shift focus as needed to salient details 

Distributed cognition — the ability to interact meaningfully with tools that expand mental capacities 

Collective intelligence — the ability to pool knowledge and compare notes with others toward a common goal 

Judgment — the ability to evaluate the reliability and credibility of different information sources 

Transmedia navigation — the ability to follow the flow of stories and information across multiple modalities 

Networking — the ability to search for, synthesize, and disseminate information 

Negotiation — the ability to travel across diverse communities, discerning and respecting multiple perspectives, and grasping and following alternative norms.
