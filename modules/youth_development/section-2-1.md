You can edit your life on Instagram. I think people think I’m cooler than I am.” -- Lilli Hymowitz 

What is identity and how does it develop? There are two classic theoretical approaches of viewing adolescent identity formation — the psychological and the sociological view — both of which can shed light on youth’s digital media use and how teen identity and intimacy play out in a social media landscape. 

Psychological views of identity focus on youth separating from their parents and figuring out who they are in society. Sherry Turkle’s early research about the Internet15 celebrated anonymous online spaces as potential avenues for identity exploration. Today, with digital and networked technologies embedded in many young people’s lives, and with mistakes preserved online long after their teen years, it is harder for teens to achieve this type of freedom.  

Sociological views of identity treat identity as a social and cultural construction, arguing that we become ourselves as we interact and learn from people, culture, and society. Teens engage in impression management, particularly online, to manage other people’s perceptions of them. This is complicated when family, peer, and school contexts are present in an online space.
