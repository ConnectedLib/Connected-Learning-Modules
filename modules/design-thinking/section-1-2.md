Design may already be a tacit component of your work with youth.<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> For example, after planning and organizing a library event, you might reflect on the experience and make changes based on the feedback you receive.<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Additionally, designing with youth involves unique processes that must take into consideration who youth are (age ranges, developmental stages) and the environments in which they interact (schools, libraries, homes).<sup><a name="3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Design can be seen in various aspects of librarianship spaces, references, and youth services.  

As a youth librarian, you can use design thinking in a variety of ways. The design thinking framework may be used within programming activities as tool for learning.<sup><a name="4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Or you can use design thinking methods for solving your own challenges or to create new initiatives for your library.<sup><a name="4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup> Design thinking can be another skill set you can bring to the table with what you already do--being actively engaged with youth in your community.
