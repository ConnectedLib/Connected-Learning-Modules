Design-thinking research methods are techniques and tools to understand the people you are designing for and to inspire you to consider new directions. These methods can be used by both you or your youth community. The following section provides more ways to integrate the design thinking mindset into each phase of the design process. 

### Imagination  

>“Designers engage with users (people!) to understand their needs and gain insights about their lives.” (d.school, 2016) 

The imagination phase of the design process centers on understanding the people who may use your new design or experience. By observing and talking to people, you may find inspiration for new initiatives, uncover hidden challenges, or gain more insight into a community.
