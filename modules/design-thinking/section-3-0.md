Design-thinking research methods are techniques and tools to understand the people you are designing for and to inspire you to consider new directions. These methods can be used by both you or your youth community. The following section provides more ways to integrate the design thinking mindset into each phase of the design process. 

### Imagination  

>“Designers engage with users (people!) to understand their needs and gain insights about their lives.” (d.school, 2016) 

The imagination phase of the design process centers on understanding the people who may use your new design or experience. By observing and talking to people, you may find inspiration for new initiatives, uncover hidden challenges, or gain more insight into a community. Below are key research methods for exploring unfamiliar communities as well as understanding the people you want to impact.  

#### Observation  

Look around you. What would you or youth like to change or improve about your library or community ? The research method of observation—watching how people behave and interact within spaces and places—can uncover needs of others, capture the context, and guide innovation efforts (d.school steps, 2016).

<p><span class="box-title">OBSERVATION IN ACTION: LISTENING IN COMMUNITY SPACES</span></p>
<p>Paul, a youth librarian at an urban, Northwestern library, discussed his approach to learning about youth interests by observing the culture of his community. He said: “I could be standing next to groups of teens outside of the movie theater, and always listening to the conversations to...the themes that they're talking about.” He also investigated the local entertainment industry, noting his community’s DJ culture. “Look, it's an entertainment industry, there's a lot of DJs in town. Why don't we start creating our own DJs?"</p>

#### Interviewing Target Communities and Leveraging Community Partners  

You can also talk directly with your target community or tap into community partners to understand others’ their lived experiences. While it’s not always possible to conduct a formal interview, you may have performed “informal interviewing”, or asked for information and advice from target communities or community partners.  

Here are few general tips for both formal or informal interviews:  

- **Seek out community opinions, advice, or personal experiences**. For instance, if you are integrating a new technology in your teen space, ask your community partners if they’ve had experiences with it and what their impressions are about it. (See our Community Partnerships module for more information)  
- **Prepare your questions ahead of time**. Start with broad questions (job, household demographics, daily activities) that people are comfortable with answering. After understanding more about their lifestyle, proceed with specific questions that might relate to your design challenge. (IDEO, design kit, 2016).  
- **Encourage stories and anecdotes**. Questions for eliciting stories might be: “Tell me about a time when…” or  “What was your experience in integrating this technology?”  
- **Attempt to interview people in the context and environment in which they live or work**. Write down notes about the surroundings and body language.

<div class="case_study_box">  
<p><span class="box-title">INTERVIEWING TARGET COMMUNITIES IN ACTION: LEVERAGING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS</span></p>
<p>Vanessa, a youth librarian at a suburban, Southern library focuses on involving community stakeholders in the process to understand her community. She says that she brainstorms with teens first and then brings their ideas to other partners for advice. She offers: “....even having the teens talk to other people in the community about, "Hey, what do you see as a need?" And, "Is this a good idea? Do you think from your perspective as a program manager at a Boys and Girls Club that this will be something that teens you know would be interested in?"</p>  
</div>

#### Interviewing Experts  

Interviewing experts is another way for both you and youth to become inspired by the experiences of others. You might think about interviewing someone with deep experience or knowledge in a relevant area of your design challenge. Or perhaps your youth community has a hobby or career interest in a local industry or profession. For example, if teens are interested in a cooking or food project, you could speak with a professional chef (Cooper-Wright, 2015). 

<div class="case_study_box">  
<p><span class="box-title">INTERVIEWING EXPERTS IN ACTION: [Text Wrapping Break]CONFRONTING THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN LITERATURE</span></p>
<p>Teens at a suburban Pacific Northwest library with a large Asian population discovered a distinct issue with what they were reading for the YA book club. They came to youth librarians, wondering: “There's nobody in these books that's like me. Why not?” Given these questions, teens and librarians developed a diversity panel that included authors of books about diversity and a book publisher. During the panel interview with literature professionals they discussed a pressing question: Why there isn't there more diversity in current literature? Throughout the panel, the youth produced all their own questions and learned directly from experts about the challenges of the writing industry.</p>

### Participatory Design 

Participatory Design (PD), also called co-design, involves the stakeholders, designers, researchers and users of a new technology, product, program, or service in the design process. This approach helps to ensure that the final design meets the needs of its intended audience. Thus, the user of the service would participate in some aspect of the design process, whether it’s helping to brainstorm ideas, critique working design, or create mockups of new design. When working with youth, PD can be a way for youth to take an active role in designing which may lead to the development of a strong sense of accomplishment or even interest in design (Braun, 2003). As such, youth can be seen as “problem-solvers” and “experts” without formal design education and training (Subramaniam, 2016).  

**You may want to run a Participatory Design session or workshop if you want to:**

- Understand how people or youth think about a given issue, technology, service or program in your library 
- Learn and observe things that may be difficult to discover in interviews or surveys 
- Ensure that teens are “equal partners in designing programming and services”(Subramaniam, 2016).  

Many techniques exist for designing with and for youth and Participatory Design exercises can be included into the design process with youth in a variety of ways. Some ideas include: 

- **Bags of stuff** (low tech prototyping). Prototypes can be anything that takes a design idea and puts it into physical form (d.school, 2016). Using “bags of stuff” (e.g. arts and crafts materials such as construction paper, legos, and pipe cleaners), librarians can engage teens in building out their ideas visually or 3 dimensionally (Subramaniam, 2016). You can use this technique to help form ideas for such projects as designing makerspaces, teen spaces, and learning labs.  
- **Big Paper**. Big pads or rolled sheets of paper can give you or your group the space to draw out ideas, plan out steps, or cross items out. Having a big piece of paper on a whiteboard allows you to step back and view the ideas front and center. Using big paper, it’s often easier to take photos of your brainstorming results for later review.  
- **Sticky Noting**. “Teens use sticky noting to evaluate or critique a prototype or idea that is in development (such as a low-tech prototypes)”(Subramaniam, 2016). For this technique, pens/pencils and sticky notes (also known as Post-it notes) are needed. Adults and teen design partners use or view the idea or technology and display their likes, dislikes, surprises, and design ideas using sticky notes on a whiteboard (Subramaniam, 2016)”.  

In Participatory Design, youth should not focus on coming up with “correct answers”.  Instead, you can guide them to focus on building out their ideas and explaining their design concepts.  

### Ideation  

The ideation phase focuses on refining your ideas. You don’t need to use expensive or cutting-edge tools. Many of the following ideation techniques can be completed using paper and pen. Thus, the following section focuses on everyday tools and techniques you can integrate into your work with youth.  

### Brainstorming 

The brainstorming technique often occurs throughout the different stages of the design process or within a Participatory Design session. You’ve probably used brainstorming in a variety of ways such as discovering programming ideas, planning community partnerships, or collaborating with other youth librarians. In addition to sticky noting and big pieces of paper, some other everyday tools you can use to assist in brainstorming sessions include: 

- **Photos, Magazines, or Found Images**. Incorporate photos or found images into your brainstorming session to elicit responses or opinions. For instance, you or youth can flip through magazines as inspiration or to collage out ideas. You can also use imagery to display the direction of your ideas or inspire you to think in new ways (OpenIDEO, 2011). For more about the use of visuals in the ideation phase, see our section on Design Representations.  
- **Sketchbooks**. You or youth can jot down your ideas and notes on the fly or develop sketches of a working design.  
- **Online brainstorming tools**. Explore brainstorming tools, like Bubbl.us (https://bubbl.us/) or LucidChart (https://www.lucidchart.com/) to collaborate with others on ideas.  

Here are some general tips from youth librarians around the US on how they approach brainstorming and ideation : 

- **Moderate and lead the brainstorming session to keep order and allow all voices to be heard**. “Rissa”, a youth librarian at an urban, Eastern library uses candy as a motivator for young people to take turns during a Teen Advisory brainstorming session: “To begin a  [Teen Advisory] meeting, I put a piece of candy in front of each guest. I say, "Don't eat it." And I say, "Okay, now if you give me another good idea like something we could do, I'll give you another piece of candy. Don't eat it. Keep it all in front of you. Now, if you interrupt someone, they get to take your candy."  
- **Use online communities and create a system to collect ideas**. “Amelia”, a youth librarian at a rural, Southern library subscribes to several LISTERVS where librarians share ideas. She keeps a running list within her email account and keeps track of some of the different things she hopes to try.  
- **Stay open**. David, a librarian at an urban, Pacific Northwest library focuses on a “sky’s the limit approach” to developing new ideas. During the initial brainstorming, he says that things like budget or timelines should not be a focus.  **Remember**: Criticism of any ideas should also be avoided! You can worry about particulars at other stages of the design process.  

### Design Representations 

Along with brainstorming, other techniques for idea generation include design representations, or methods to encourage hands-on experience in designing and bringing ideas to life without using complex or expensive tools. For instance, ideas can be illustrated through or by drawing the ideas out on a whiteboard during the brainstorming session. Design representations help you and your audience understand what you're trying to build, offer a proposed solution, or provide a chance for feedback. 

A few design representation methods include: 

- **Mock ups**. Using just a sketch pad or a whiteboard, you draw out what your design or new service might look like. If you can have a potential audience who will use your design to sketch out their own ideas--even better! Think about how you might use mock ups in presenting your ideas to potential stakeholders.  
- **Personas**. Using the personas method, you and/or youth will visualize and write out the key characteristics of the different users of your design or idea. This method helps you tailor your design to specific demographics or communities. Ideally, you have completed interviewing and observations of people to form your personas (Olsen, 2004). Questions for building personas include: 
  - Who am I? 
  - What are my interests? 
  - What’s my personality? 
  - What is my work and home environment? (DIY Toolkit, 2016)  
- **Photo Essays**. Through photo essays, you have potential users photograph their experiences throughout a day. This gives you a visual “day in the life” of that person (IDEO, Design Thinking Toolkit, 2016). This method helps you understand a person’s everyday, lived experiences.  
- **Prototypes**. As we outlined in our section on Participatory Design, prototypes are models that let you test your ideas cheaply and quickly (Jacobsen, 2016). Prototypes can represent objects, services, or spaces. For example, as a youth librarian, you might introduce a smaller, pop up low-fidelity (or simple) prototype of a makerspace using paper sketches or printouts before investing into a full-scale maker environment.  
- **Storyboards**. As a low cost prototype to help you envision a project or story from start to finish, consider the use of  a storyboard, or a sequence of images and words that form a narrative (IDEO Toolkit, 2016). You and youth can use storyboards to map out your idea using tools like post-its and white boards. 

### Iteration   

By testing your ideas, you will have the chance to refine and improve them. The iteration phase is an ongoing part of the design process (d.school, Bootleg Bootcamp 2010). At this point you can obtain feedback on your idea, place prototypes in front of people, and rework things as you hear critiques.  

Here are a few ways to test and refine ideas during the iteration phase: 
- Develop scenarios and role play. Scenarios are stories that attempt to frame your design idea or new service in a real life (or imagined) situation. For instance, if you create a scenario around a new service, ask others to play out the different roles of the people affected by it. Role-playing might help you uncover hidden issues in implementing your design. 
- Present your mock ups or large sketches of your idea in the form of an advertisement or poster for patrons and youth to view at the library. Provide the chance for people to write down their comments and give their feedback about the idea.  
- Use social and digital platforms to promote ideas, prototypes, or design processes to elicit feedback and create awareness. Digital photography and social platforms can allow you to document the process, showcase the creations of youth, and demonstrate how the project evolved.  
- Apply any feedback and new research to revise and iterate as part of an ongoing process. Remember: Sometimes creating a new design or service is more about progress than perfection!  

Implementation of the new design or service is the final step after the iteration phase. As you implement your new design or experience, take note of any user behavior and see just how people interact with your design in a real setting. At any point, you may wish to cycle back to different phases in the design process—refining and developing your project or new service over time. It may take several attempts at restructuring your new initiative before it reaches its final form.
