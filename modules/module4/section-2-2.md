Providing “multiple pathways” involves creating networks and infrastructures across learning contexts in order to connect youth to the tools and support they need to succeed on their own terms. Teens can follow many pathways through a network of resources, having the freedom to move from one context or topic to another at will.

## What do multiple pathways look like? 
* Teens have access to a “kitchen” or “menu” of resources they can choose from to create their own projects
* Learning occurs and creations are shared across contexts
* Achievement is recognized through shareable products like badges or digital portfolios
* Teens can connect projects and resources in whatever way fits their individual interests and goals
