This section discusses learning about individuals, associations, and institutions in your community. 

**Learning About Your Youth Patrons** 

You may already be pretty familiar with the young people who visit your library regularly. But are they representative of the community at large? Compare your community profile with the information about your “regulars.” Are there demographic groups that aren’t being served or aren’t represented?

As youth librarians, you are more likely than many people to recognize that youth have gifts and capacities to help their communities. Teens may know their communities as well as or better than adults, bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the table, and have connections to schools, families, and other teens. Youth may be seen as more credible than adults to their peers.5 Building Communities from the Inside Out provides many suggestions as to how youth can build productive connections with associations, organizations, and other individuals (Chapter 1, pages 33-44).

**Learning about other individuals**

>“Each time a person uses his or her capacity, the community is stronger and the person more powerful. That is why strong communities are basically places where the capacities of local residents are identified, valued, and used.” -- Kretzmann, J. P., & McKnight, J. L. (1993). Building from the inside out: A path toward finding and mobilizing a community’s assets. Chicago, IL: ACTA Publications. P. 13. 

The most foundational assets of a community are the individuals that form it. Every individual has gifts that they can share with their community -- like knowledge, a skill, or physical space, to name just a few.  

<ul>
<li>Members of this category can be specific people, but can also be demographic groups: for instance, young parents, high school students, or seniors.</li>

<li>If you encounter individuals who want to work with the library but aren’t sure how they can help, completing a skills and interests inventory can help.</li>

<li>You can use the 4H approach in interviews, focus groups, or community meetings to help individuals identify their “gifts.” The four H’s are: 
<ul>
 <li>Head - knowledge that can be shared.</li>

 <li>Heart - passions and values.</li>

 <li>Hands - skills that can be taught to others, or that can help others.</li>

 <li>Home - communities that you are a part of.</li>

  <li>See Ryan & Bourke, 2008, pp. 182 - 189 for more details and worksheets.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>When you’re focusing on individuals as assets, your goal will be to help each individual contribute to the community or the library. This is different than if you are talking to individuals to help create a portrait of your community (don’t use the capacity inventory for this). You should avoid making individuals feel “used” or “studied” (Kretzmann & McKnight, 1993, p.17).</li>

<li><b>Seniors.</b> Seniors can be tremendous library assets with their experience and knowledge of cultural and community history. Many retirees have skills they are happy to share with teens; others can help connect the library to associations and organizations they are or were involved with.</li>

<li><b>Marginalized groups.</b> Don’t write off groups that are traditionally thought of as only having needs, not assets, like people with disabilities or people from a lower SES. Everyone is an asset the library could potentially work with.</li>
<br>
<br>
<div class="resources">
<span class="box-title">DO ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE CAPACITIES?</span>
<p>Kretzmann & McKnight argue that need-focused labels, like “ex-convict”, “elderly,” “illiterate”, and “gang member” reflect and reinforce society’s belief that these “needy” people are “empty” and without anything to contribute to their community. Asset-based development means looking past labels to each individual’s specific gifts.<br>
For example, “She is a pregnant teenager. She needs counseling, therapy, residential services, special education.” But also, “She is Mary Smith. She has a miraculously beautiful voice. We need her in the choir. She needs a record producer.” Her label, pregnant teenager, tells of emptiness and calls forth rejection, isolation and treatment. Her name, Mary Smith, tells of her gifts and evokes community and contributions.”<br>

**Associations**

Associations are groups of community members who gather together voluntarily around a common interest or goal. Associations are key to getting the community involved in your teen services.  

<ul>
<li>Since associations are already formed around an interest, topic, or area, their potential contributions can be easier to identify. They may have expertise, equipment or other specialized resources to share. They can also be a source of donations or facilities.</li>  

<li>Associations may already have outreach programs or services for the community that can be modified for use with your teens.</li>   
<li>Find out what the association’s goals and mission are. This can help you find ways that getting involved with the library will help the association.</li> 

<li>The smaller and more informal an association is, the less documented it will be. As you are talking to individuals, ask them what kinds of associations they belong to or know of.</li> 
</ul>

**Institutions** 

Institutions (as defined by ABCD) are groups of people brought together professionally -- such as business, schools, government agencies. They often have many resources that can be shared with the community.  
<ul>
<li>Even more than associations, institutions are likely to have outreach programs at the ready for the community.  

<li>Institutions are also more likely to have space or money to help your teen services.  

<li>An institution’s hiring practices can be one of its assets<sup>[6](#fn6)</sup>. 

**Methods for learning more**  

Depending on your situation, you can use surveys or focus groups to learn more about your community’s assets. You can also use the methods described in the Capacity module (interviews and town halls), or any combination of methods.

<table>
<tr><th bgcolor="#F5A750" width="40%" align="center">SURVEYS</th><td>Informal interviews are open-ended interviews that  do not require you to use a tape recorder. Because of this, they can be an accessible way to interact with your community in a non-intimidating manner. <br> 
Much like “On the Street Interviews,” informal interviews can be performed in your library, outside in the community, at    the grocery store... the opportunities are endless.<br>
Step 1: 
<ul><li>Prepare a few questions to ask ahead of time</ul></li>
Step 2:  
<ul><li>Memorize the essence of one or two questions (it does not have to be word for word)</ul></li>
Step 3:  
<ul><li>Ask these questions on the fly while in conversation with your community</ul></li>
Step 4: 
<ul><li>Write a summary of the conversation afterwards for future reference</ul></li></th></tr>
