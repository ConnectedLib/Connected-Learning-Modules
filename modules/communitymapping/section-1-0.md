>“You have to look at your local industry, study it carefully, interpret your local demographic, interpret your local workforce, and then try to find a newsworthy, best practice program that is hands-on, self-directed, project-based, and fun, and teens will come in.”<br/>— Urban Western Library

Community mapping is a systematic approach to getting to know the people, places, and resources that surround your library. It is a way to take stock of “the gifts, skills and capacities of individuals, voluntary associations, institutions, physical assets, local economy assets and stories in the community.”<sup><a href="#fn1" name="1">1</a></sup> The community mapping process may draw on, among other sources of information, 
- Interviews
- Surveys
- Focus groups
- Statistics about your community
- Business directories

Learning more about the people in your community (and not just those that already use the library) can help you 

- Identify ways for the library to better meet the wants and needs of your community
- Find opportunities to reach new audiences
- Uncover groups that are not being reached by the library

Getting to know the associations, businesses, and other resources in your community can help you
- Find experts to mentor your teens or help with programs
- Discover physical resources you can leverage
- Understand what is available to your community from sources outside the library
- Identify or form relationships that can lead to partnerships

Community mapping focuses on the strengths and assets of a community instead of on weaknesses and gaps, leading to unconventional programs that leverage a community’s unique strengths. This module will walk you through the steps of the mapping process, whether you are planning a large initiative that will take several months, or setting aside an afternoon by yourself.
