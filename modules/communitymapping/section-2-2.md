<tr><th>Individuals</th><td>The most foundational assets of a community are the individuals that form it. Every individual has gifts that they can share with their community -- like knowledge, a skill, or physical space, to name just a few.</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Associations</th><td>Association are groups of community members who gather together voluntarily around a common interest. Associations are key to getting the community involved in your teen services. </td></tr>
  <tr><th>Institutions</th><td>Institutions are groups of people brought together professionally -- such as business, schools, government agencies. They often have many resources that can be shared with the community. </td></tr>
<tr><th>Physical Assets</th><td>Individuals, associations, and institutions can all provide gifts in the form of physical assets, like land, buildings, equipment, and money.</td></tr>
<tr><th>Connections</th><td>Connections are the relationships between the other types of assets. Creating new connections between community assets can greatly increase the opportunities for connected learning in your library. You can think of connections as an expression of social capital.2 </td></tr>
