Now that we have briefly revisited how to assess community assets and strengths and reframed in terms of our library’s capacity, we are well prepared to think deeply about community needs. In the following section, we will also be covering how we might be able to leverage the strengths in our community to meet those needs. 

**Leveraging Community Assets to Address Community Needs** 

> “Each time a person uses his or her capacity, the community is stronger and the person more powerful. That is why strong communities are basically places where the capacities of local residents are identified, valued, and used.” <sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

The needs and assets of your community are two sides of the same coin. Being able to map out both your community assets and your community needs gives you a comprehensive picture of your library’s capacity in relation to its unique community. Community needs can include the needs of community organizations, groups, and individuals. A good example of a community organization need is the lack of a meeting space, or perhaps funding to cover organization activities. A need on the individual level includes things like accommodation needs, or the need for clean drinking water. Examining your community closely can help you to understand what gaps exist between what is currently available and what should be available. 

Community needs and assets connect directly with assessing the capacity of your library. What are your capacity needs? How are they related to community needs? What assets can you leverage to fill these gaps? 

When assessing community needs it is important to collect information from as many members of the community as possible. Luckily, you’ve already identified some tools to do this in our Community Mapping module, in section 3.4 “Learn About Your Community Assets.” In this section we will be discussing additional tools that you can use which are especially strong when assessing your library’s capacity and community needs. As a starting point, brainstorming about your community and identifying the groups that make up your community can be helpful. Talking with other workers in your library, as well as patrons, can help you to make sure you have not left any community members out of your analysis. From here, there are a variety of next steps that you can follow to assess the needs of your community: 
Then, we will expand to list their strengths:
