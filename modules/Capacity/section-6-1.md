Many libraries face capacity challenges that can make addressing community needs a challenge. These can include challenges in all aspects of capacity, including space, technology acquisition, technology use, staff, and partnerships. Our goal in this section is to make troubleshooting capacity challenges at your library accessible, so you can feel confident in your library’s capacity to provide connected learning infused programs.  

Here is a broad list of common capacity challenges: 
<ul>
<li>Small library</li>
<li>Low technology budget</li>
<li>Low acquisitions budget</li>
<li>Small volunteer group</li>
<li>Minimal teen attendance</li>
</ul>

  <tr><td bgcolor="#F5A750" width="30%"><b>Small Library</b></td><td>>b>Small Libraries</b>often have difficulty providing space for engaging library programs, as well as compounding challenges that come hand in hand with having a smaller library, like a typically lower annual budget than larger libraries. Here, we will be focusing on space. How can you troubleshoot space capacity in a small library?<br><br> 
Tips and tricks:
<ul><li>Make use of community partnerships that have large meeting spaces
  <ul><li>Determine which library programs or outreach programs can be done outside of the library</ul></li></li>
<ul><li>Ask these questions on the fly while in conversation with your community</ul>
Step 4: 
<ul><li>Write a summary of the conversation afterwards for future reference</ul></li></li>

<tr><td bgcolor="#F3CC4D" width="40%"><b>Town Halls</b></td><td>Town Halls are planned get togethers with your community where you discuss current issues, events, and other information. These are similar to focus groups, which we covered in Community Mapping.<br><br>
Town Halls can be formal or  informal, and can be conducted simply as community “get togethers” with coffee, snacks, and a few questions asked for the group to answer after you’ve done some mingling or tackled other library business.<br><br>
This is an example of how an informal town hall event brought residents together into a shared space that was less intimidating:<br><a href="http://www.courant.com/community/bloomfield/hc-news-bloomfield-town-hall-meeting-20180123-story.html">http://www.courant.com/community/bloomfield/hc-news-bloomfield-town-hall-meeting-20180123-story.html</a><br>
Here is an example of how Anne Arundel County Public Library performed formal town halls regarding budget cuts:<br>

<tr><td bgcolor="#B969A1" width="40%"><b>Other Informal Methods</b></td><td>Other informal methods include: 
 <ol><li>"<b>Postcard Surveys</b>” where you send a postcard with close ended questions and community members can mark it and mail it back</li>  
<li>Using the “<b>Grape Vine</b>” by asking a key member of a certain organization to ask their members a few questions and get back to you with their answers</li>
<li><b>Observation</b>: attending community events, organizations, schools, and other locations where your community meets and simply observing. What are some issues being raised?</li>
