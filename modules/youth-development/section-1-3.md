>“From constructivist theories of psychology we take a view of learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge. Then we extend the idea of manipulative materials to the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product.”<br/>— Seymour Papert<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

Informed by both Piaget and Vygotsky, Seymour Papert (1928-2016, and a founding faculty member of the <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_programming.html" target="_blank">MIT Media Lab</a> developed the concept of **constructionism**. Based on Piaget’s constructivism, constructionism emphasizes the agency of young people as active participants in the construction of their own learning. Papert developed one of the first educational programming languages, known as <a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/what_is_logo/logo_programming.html" target="_blank">LOGO</a>, which inspired the popular programming language <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. Papert’s work also led to the <a href="http://www.computerclubhouse.org/" target="_blank">Computer Clubhouse project</a>, a network of over 100 learning centers where youth from underserved communities learn to create and express themselves using emerging technologies.

## Putting constructionism into practice

>“It's your job to experiment, it's your job to problem solve, your job to critically think. I'm here to guide you."<br/>— Rural Western Library  

**Production-centered** learning that is based on learners’ own **interests** are two principles of connected learning that were directly inspired by constructionism. Constructionist learning experiences can involve:  

- Learning that is characterized as learner-centered, active, hands-on, or project-based<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>  
- Facilitators who guide learners but allow them to make decisions about the direction of their project 
- “Tools that can promote the making of objects” like robotics kits, 3D printers, or even a simple craft set<sup><a name="3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 
- Self-directed learning that allows youth to experiment with tools and relate them to their own personal interests<sup><a name="4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
- Technologies that provide flexibility and openness,<sup><a name="5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup> like <a href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/middle-school/shop/products?gclid=Cj0KEQjwmcTJBRCYirao6oWPyMsBEiQA9hQPboKcMkN_KrvRpaYdsnS1_trkGgx4U2pmcwCIWt3b4t4aAmuL8P8HAQ" target="_blank">Lego Mindstorms</a>, which allow learners to build and program a robot themselves. (Lego Mindstorms were inspired by and named after Papert’s book <a href="https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas</a>)

  <p>Think about a library program you know about that involves constructing or creating something. What knowledge is the program helping learners to create? </p>
