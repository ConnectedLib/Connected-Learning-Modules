Explore what’s going on in a teen’s mind — literally — and learn how to apply a developmental lens to your youth programming. 

<div class="objectives">
<p>After completing this module, you will be able to...</p>
<ul>
	<li>Describe major theories of youth development and apply them to the creation of connected learning programs for teens (<a href="section-1-0.html">Section 1: Theories of Youth Development</a>).</li>
	<li>Understand how identity, relationships, and morality affect a teen’s development (<a href="section-2-0.html">Section 2: Developing an Identity</a>).</li>
	<li>Summarize trends in teens’ use of digital media and explain how the role of teen services in libraries is changing (<a href="section-3-0.html">Section 3: Teens and Digital Media</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>

In this module, we’ll explore how youth grow and learn, develop their own identity in relation to others, and make use of digital media. We’ll also explore how libraries can support tweens and teens with their developmental progress every step of the way.
