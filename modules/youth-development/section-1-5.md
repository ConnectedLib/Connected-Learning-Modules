>“Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children with persons both older and younger than themselves.”<br/><br/>— Urie Bronfenbrenner<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

Developmental psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner (1917-2005) emphasized the importance of studying children and adults in real life settings, instead of labs, and examining all the socio-cultural contexts in which growth and development occurs.<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

Bronfenbrenner’s model is a series of nested contexts: 

- The **microsystem** is the innermost system; it contains people and settings that directly involve a young person, such as their home, family, peer group, work, or school.  
- The **mesosystem** is an interaction or connection between two or more entities in the microsystem — for instance, parents visiting school, or friends visiting the young person’s home.  
- The **exosystem** contains settings that do not directly involve the young person, but that may still affect their life. For instance, a child may never visit their parent’s workplace, but events that occur there may affect the child indirectly. 
- The **macrosystem** involves patterns and characteristics of a culture, like a community or society’s norms and values that shape and affect the youth experience.  
- The **chronosystem** represents the passage of time, focusing on changes in the youth’s environment. Changes in family structure, socioeconomic status, and residency can greatly impact developmental outcomes.  

Each of these systems interrelate and interact with one another, demonstrating the role of environmental factors in a young person’s development over time.
