## General Assessment and Evaluation Resources

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents" target="_blank">Community Toolbox</a> provides a detailed <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/evaluate/evaluation" target="_blank">Introduction to Evaluation</a> from a community development perspective.</li>

  <li>For a deeper dive into evaluating connected learning programs, <a href="https://dmlcommons.net/2016-course/" target="_blank">Program Evaluations for Connected Learning</a> (William Penuel & Carrie Allen, 2016) is a free online course consisting of eight modules covering topics like "measuring and using implementation evidence" and “developing a theory of change to guide evaluation.”</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.betterevaluation.org/" target="_blank">BetterEvaluation</a> is an extensive collection of information for every stage and aspect of evaluation.</li>

  <li>IMLS (2015) has collected a list of <a href="https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/evaluation-resources" target="_blank">Evaluation Resources</a> from a variety of sources.</li>
</ul>

## Assessing and Evaluating in Informal Learning Contexts
<ul>
  <li>See Chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12614" target="_blank">Surrounded by Science</a> (Marilyn Fenichel & Heidi A. Schweingruber, 2010) for a discussion of “Assessing Learning Outcomes.”</li>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation/pi-guide" target="_blank">Principal Investigator’s Guide: Managing Evaluation in Informal STEM Education Projects</a> (CAISE, 2011) was written for NSF-funded projects, but it contains extensive advice and examples that are useful for any informal learning context.</li> 

  <li>Chapter 5 of Putting Teens First in Library Services: A Roadmap, (Linda Braun & Shannon Peterson, eds., 2017), discusses “Assessments and Outcome-Based Evaluation in Formal and Informal Learning Spaces.” (Chicago, IL: YALSA).</li>

  <li>Chapters 5 through 10 of <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/framework-evaluating-impacts-informal-science-education-projects" target="_blank">Framework for Evaluating Impacts of Informal Science Education Projects</a>, edited by Alan J. Friedman for the National Science Foundation, discuss the challenges of evaluating particular types of informal learning experiences like exhibits or media productions.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation" target="_blank">InformalScience.org</a> has a set of evaluation resources specifically designed for informal STEM learning.</li>
  </ul>
