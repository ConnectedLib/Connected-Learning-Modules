## General Assessment and Evaluation Resources

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents" target="_blank">Community Toolbox</a> provides a detailed <a href="http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/evaluate/evaluation" target="_blank">Introduction to Evaluation</a> from a community development perspective.</li>

  <li>For a deeper dive into evaluating connected learning programs, <a href="https://dmlcommons.net/2016-course/" target="_blank">Program Evaluations for Connected Learning</a> (William Penuel & Carrie Allen, 2016) is a free online course consisting of eight modules covering topics like "measuring and using implementation evidence" and “developing a theory of change to guide evaluation.”</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.betterevaluation.org/" target="_blank">BetterEvaluation</a> is an extensive collection of information for every stage and aspect of evaluation.</li>

  <li>IMLS (2015) has collected a list of <a href="https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/evaluation-resources" target="_blank">Evaluation Resources</a> from a variety of sources.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://diytoolkit.org/tools/learning-loop/" target="_blank">Learning Loop Tool</a> from the <a href="http://diytoolkit.org/tools/learning-loop/" target="_blank">DIY Toolkit</a> can help you use lessons learned from the past when creating a new initiative.</li>
</ul>

## Assessing and Evaluating in Informal Learning Contexts
<ul>
  <li>The Connected Learning Alliance has produced a detailed toolkit for evaluating connecting learning programs titled <a href="https://clalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Evaluating-Library-Programming.pdf" target="_blank">Evaluating library programming: A practical guide to collecting and analyzing data to improve or evaluate connected learning programs for youth in libraries</a>.</li>
  <li>See Chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12614" target="_blank">Surrounded by Science</a> (Marilyn Fenichel & Heidi A. Schweingruber, 2010) for a discussion of “Assessing Learning Outcomes.”</li>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation/pi-guide" target="_blank">Principal Investigator’s Guide: Managing Evaluation in Informal STEM Education Projects</a> (CAISE, 2011) was written for NSF-funded projects, but it contains extensive advice and examples that are useful for any informal learning context.</li> 

  <li>Chapter 5 of Putting Teens First in Library Services: A Roadmap, (Linda Braun & Shannon Peterson, eds., 2017), discusses “Assessments and Outcome-Based Evaluation in Formal and Informal Learning Spaces.” (Chicago, IL: YALSA).</li>

  <li>Chapters 5 through 10 of <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/framework-evaluating-impacts-informal-science-education-projects" target="_blank">Framework for Evaluating Impacts of Informal Science Education Projects</a>, edited by Alan J. Friedman for the National Science Foundation, discuss the challenges of evaluating particular types of informal learning experiences like exhibits or media productions.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation" target="_blank">InformalScience.org</a> has a set of evaluation resources specifically designed for informal STEM learning.</li>
  </ul>

## Tools and Instruments

  <ul>
<li>The PEAR Institute’s <a href="http://www.pearweb.org/atis/reviews/420" target="_blank">Assessment Tools in Informal Science</a> is a database of assessment instruments, complete with user reviews.</li> 

<li>The <a href="http://stelar.edc.org/resources" target="_blank">STEM Learning and Research Center</a> also has a database of assessment instruments.</li>  

<li>The <a href="" target="_blank">Activation Lab</a> provides instruments to assess science learning activation, as well as an <a href="http://www.activationlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ObservationProtocolFINAL.pdf" target="_blank">observation protocol</a> to measure engagement with learning.</li>  

<li>IDEO has created a <a href="http://www.designkit.org/methods" target="_blank">Human-Centered Design Kit</a> with dozens of methods for gathering ideas and information, many of which can be used for creatively assessing connected learning programs.</li>  

<li><a href="http://www.informalscience.org" target="_blank">InformalScience.org</a> has a collection of <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation/browse-evaluation?search_api_views_fulltext=&sort_by=field_resource_date_value" target="_blank">evaluation materials</a> from informal STEM learning projects, including evaluation reports and assessment instruments.</li>
</ul>
