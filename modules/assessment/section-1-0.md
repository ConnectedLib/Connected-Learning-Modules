>“You don't need a lot of technical expertise to do this. You just need the discipline of thinking first about what the outcome is, what young people might say or do that would give you some indicator, and think hard about the situations that would elicit those things that a student might say or do.” -- Dr. William Penuel (University of Colorado at Boulder)<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

Evaluation and assessment are important to all library activities, but it can be particularly challenging to assess and evaluate connected learning initiatives. In this module, you will learn how to assess the impacts of connected learning and evaluate connected learning initiatives. You will learn how to evaluate your library programs and initiatives: identifying desired outcomes, developing measures, creating an evaluation plan, collecting and analyzing data, and communicating the results to stakeholders. This introduction covers assessment and evaluation basics, including key terms and the particular challenges and opportunities posed by connected learning initiatives. In Section 2, you will learn how to conduct an assessment by determining what you need to measure, collecting the data, and analyzing it. In Section 3, you will learn how evaluations are used to answer questions, and how to put together a solid evaluation plan to serve as a roadmap for your evaluation project. Section 4 explores how you can use the results once you finish the evaluation process.  

### What is an assessment?  

Although the terms “evaluation” and “assessment” are often used interchangeably in everyday usage, in many fields (such as education and community development) they are distinct concepts.  

An assessment is an activity that collects data to use as evidence to answer a question. For example, you may want to know what your young patrons think about your library’s teen space. In order to answer this question, you could conduct any number of assessments. You could observe the teens using the space, taking note of how they interact with the space and what they do in it. You could ask teens what they think directly by conducting interviews or distributing a survey. Whatever method you choose, you are collecting data (observations, statements from the interviews, or survey results) which you will analyze and use as evidence. Perhaps most of the teens like the furniture, but want more computers or a different layout. This evidence answers your original question—what do your teenage patrons think about the teen space?  

Assessments can help you answer many different questions, such as: 
- What knowledge or skill does a teen have in a particular area?  
- What was the scale of an initiative’s impact?  
- What benchmarks should we use to help measure progress later?  
- What or how much did a teen learn from the program?  
- How do teens feel about the program? 
- What are participants’ attitudes toward a topic? 
- What was improved or achieved?  
- How many teens were helped?  
- How quickly were issues resolved?  
- What was the quality of the program implementation? 

### What is an evaluation? 

Evaluations can use the evidence from a variety of assessments to make a value judgment that helps you make a decision or make changes. For example, you may want to know how (if at all) you should change your summer programs for teens. You will need to use multiple assessments asking different sub-questions to help you address such a complex question, and you will need to holistically evaluate all the evidence you collect. Library staff, parents, and other patrons may have important input, and you’ll need to take other factors, like cost, into consideration. 

Evaluations ask and answer a “how” or “why” question, such as:  
- Was the impact of the program big enough?  
- Why didn’t a project succeed?  
- How can we make the partnership work better in the future?  

The end product of your evaluation will be an argument to convince stakeholders of the conclusions you make, which are based on evidence you construct from the data you collect through assessments. Therefore, your assessments must be designed to provide you with good evidence to use in your argument. This process can be difficult enough in a formal learning setting, but informal and connected learning present additional challenges for the youth librarian who wishes to assess learning or evaluate an initiative. We will look at those challenges next.  

### Challenges and opportunities of evaluating and assessing connected learning 

Some of the approaches used for measuring learning in a traditional classroom can be difficult or impossible to apply in connected learning settings. For example, 
- Without mandatory assessments that are possible in formal learning settings, collecting information about individual learners can be more difficult 
- While teachers can assess a student throughout a school year, before-and-after or longitudinal assessment of individuals can be virtually impossible—especially with drop-in experiences<sup>[2]<#fn2)</sup> 
- Rigorous experimental designs are difficult because learners’ motivations, prior knowledge, and experiences can vary even more than they do in schools where students are grouped by age 
- Connected learning encompasses a broader definition of “learning,” and there may not be an existing instrument that can assess the impact of the learning experiences that you are providing to your teens 
- By definition, connected learning occurs across multiple contexts, not just at the library

These challenges are not insurmountable! They’re just unfamiliar—for now. Fortunately, connected learning initiatives also present opportunities to be creative and flexible in the ways you evaluate and assess them. Your approach can be tailored for your library’s unique situation and context. Some of these opportunities include:  
- You have the ability to conduct assessments that are shorter, more flexible, and on-the-fly 
- Assessments don’t have to be broad and all-encompassing; you can assess the impact or value of single visits to the library 
- Assessing connected learning can be an excellent opportunity to learn about the social aspects of learning and group dynamics of your youth 
- An evaluation can highlight an initiative’s value to a wide range of people, not just the immediate participants 
- Creating your own instrument can help you evaluate the unique characteristics of your program 
- Participants are more likely to give authentic feedback when they feel like they are being listened to, not tested 
- You can learn how your library impacts the other “connected” aspects of participants’ lives 

By the end of this module, you will feel confident about evaluating and assessing connected learning and connected learning initiatives at your library.
