You need to collect data on your measure (or measures) in order to answer your question. Data collection can be resource-intensive, so choose your data sources and collection strategy wisely. Ask the following questions (adapted from page 53 of the <a href="https://projectoutcome.org/surveys-resources/informed-consent-guidelines" target="_blank">Principal Investigator’s Guide</a>) to guide you through the process:  

1. **What kind of information do you need?** Do you need to know about opinions or attitudes? Knowledge levels? Details about implementation?  
2. **What is the best method to obtain that information?** You have many choices for data collection—surveys, focus groups, interviews, and more.  
3. **What is the best strategy for collecting that information via that method for this project?** From whom do you need to collect information? Where is the best place to reach them via the method(s) you’ve chosen? When should this happen? If there is a facilitator, whom should that be?
