>“I've been most recently working with the Boys & Girls Club... to try and get more library programming over there for them and to help them sort of build their capacity for doing programming, either with me or without me.” -- Suburban Midwest Library

The benefits of a partnership to the library are clear, but what about the benefit to the partnering organization or individual? Remember that a partnership supports the goals of both organizations, not just the library. When you approach a potential partner you should present the ways they will benefit as well as what the library and the youth stand to gain.

<tr><th bgcolor="#F58F81" width="30%">PARTNERS CAN EXPOSE TEENS TO NEW CAREERS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND INTERESTS</tH><td>One of the most powerful ways partners can help libraries is by letting teens experience a diverse range of careers, opportunities, and interests. A professional can share expertise and real-world insight beyond what even the most accomplished teen services librarian can provide. Partners can mentor youth or library staff, and can be resources for programming. <br>

<tr><th bgcolor="#FCFB9D" width="30%">PARTNERS CAN BRING NEW AUDIENCES TO THE LIBRARY</tH><td>Partners who have already built a youth community can introduce them to the library and its resources. Organizations with established audiences might include: scouts or 4-H clubs, YMCA/YWCA, schools, school clubs (e.g. the robotics club or Lego Mindstorm club), other youth-serving organizations, and city facilities like rec centers.<br>

<tr><th bgcolor="#8DC87C" width="30%">PARTNERS CAN BRING THE LIBRARY TO NEW AUDIENCES</tH><td>Youth services librarians need to get out of the library building and go to teens “where they are, rather than waiting for teens to to find a way to get to the physical library space.”6 Partners might have spaces that youth are already using where you can bring programs. Look back at the list in the previous section—these same organizations might have spaces where you can take your programming.<br><a href="">CASE STUDY: CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG LIBRARY AND THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE</a></td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#BBD0F8" width="30%">A FULLER PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMMUNITY</tH><td>Even if library staff do a great and thorough job of getting to know the teens that come into the library, understanding the teens who don’t come into the library is a different story. Partners who work with different segments of the youth population can fill the library in on what they’re missing. <br>
