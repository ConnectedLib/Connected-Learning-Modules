>“Working with other community members can expand what a library can provide for teens and create with teens when it comes to media literacy education, and this will give teens the chance to connect to others who can play a valuable educational, informational, and personal role in their lives, especially in relation to workforce preparedness.”1  

A planetarium evaluates library branches locations for stargazing potential. A university provides mentors to work side-by-side with youth services librarians. Public and school librarians work together to provide a dynamic afterschool experience for students. Professional filmmakers work with teens who go on to win filmmaking awards and teach library workshops of their own. 

In this module, you will learn more about these examples of community partnerships—important resources for connected learning experiences that help youth services librarians provide their patrons with experiences and opportunities from outside the familiar confines of home, school, and the library itself.2  

In order to prepare youth with the 21st-century skills they need in today’s information-based society, public libraries have become “kitchen[s] for ‘mixing resources’ in order to empower teens to build skills, develop understanding, create and share, and overcome adversity.”3 To provide teens with a diverse set of “resources” to “mix,” public libraries need to reach beyond their own walls into the community. Community partnerships help libraries connect youth to learning opportunities and enrich their social networks with peers and mentors who will help them learn.4
