A **community partnership** is a formal relationship between a library and a local organization or individual who have joined forces on a project, program, or initiative that supports the goals of both entities. Unlike partnerships with national organizations, a community partnership is unique to the library and its local area. 

Partnerships are not formed by simple client and contractor relationships. Although a partnership may involve payment and contracts, it is a deeper collaboration. Partners work with the library to develop a unique offering.
