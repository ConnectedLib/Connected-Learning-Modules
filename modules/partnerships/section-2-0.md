  <li>Describe the ways that partnerships can benefit libraries</li>

A **community partnership** is a formal relationship between a library and a local organization or individual who have joined forces on a project, program, or initiative that supports the goals of both entities. Unlike partnerships with national organizations, a community partnership is unique to the library and its local area. 

Partnerships are not formed by simple client and contractor relationships. Although a partnership may involve payment and contracts, it is a deeper collaboration. Partners work with the library to develop a unique offering.

<p class="box-title">Partnerships benefit the community, too</p>

<p>The community also benefits when libraries join forces with other organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The combined resources and knowledge of the library and its partners can provide services and programs with greater impact. </li>
<li>When different organizations work together, they can reduce duplication and focus more efficiently on serving a wider audience, providing more options, or addressing a greater variety of needs. </li>
<li>Working together can enhance outreach for each organization, letting more people know about what they offer. </li>
