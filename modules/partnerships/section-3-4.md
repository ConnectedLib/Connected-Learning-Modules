>“This is such an obvious avenue for partnership that it is sometimes overlooked.” -- Tasha Squires<sup>[28](#fn28)</sup

Almost all of a community’s youth can be found in local schools at some point. Reaching teens through their schools can get them more involved with the library before the steep drop-off in participation that many librarians have reported with older teens. Partnerships with schools also build bridges between a teen’s formal and informal learning spaces—an important element of connected learning.  

Partnering with schools is particularly challenging for most of the librarians and library workers we spoke to. Very few reported having any collaborative relationship at all with their local schools, let alone a thriving partnership.

<table> 
<tr bgcolor="#000000"><th colspan = "2">OPPORTUNITIES</th></tr> 
<tr><th bgcolor="#E8B2AB">MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT</th><td>Businesses can easily contribute by providing access to equipment that the library doesn’t own, demoing or loaning products like gaming consoles or 3D printers.<sup>23,24</sup> They can donate craft materials, prizes, or even snacks — for instance, a game store could donate prizes for video game tournaments, and a cinema or grocery store could donate popcorn for movie night.</td></tr> 
<tr><th bgcolor="#CCEDC3">COMMUNITY GROUPS</th><td>Reach out to community groups like Rotary as well as topical organizations or businesses (astronomy clubs, humanities councils, art studios, etc.) to find individuals who would be willing to volunteer their time to work with youth.</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#D8C5E1">PARENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS</th><td>Parents and family members of teens who are already regular library users already know something about what the library does and what you have to offer teens. They can be valuable resources, either as volunteers themselves or as connections to businesses or community groups.</td></tr>
<tr><th bgcolor="#59adc0">EXCHANGING EXPERTISE</th><td>Library staff can provide expertise that the partnering group doesn’t have, and vice versa. For instance, a community MakerSpace can help repair a library’s broken 3D printer, while the library staff can help Makers with grant writing.</td></tr>

<table> 
<tr bgcolor="#000000"><th colspan = "2">CHALLENGES</th></tr> 
<tr><th bgcolor="#cc3300">COPORATE POLICY</th><td>Be flexible; a business may have policies that prevent them from participating in your plan, but they may be able to help out another way.<sup>25</sup> Don’t be afraid to think big — a business may be more willing to sponsor a bigger project that makes an impression, even if it costs more.<sup>26</sup> If you’re interested in a partnership with a chain or corporation, start by talking to a manager or assistant manager at the local store, not the company headquarters.<sup>27</sup></td></tr> 
<tr><th bgcolor="#F6DEB7">INEXPERIENCE WITH TEENS</th><td>The individual you’re working with may not have experience working with youth. Your skills in that area can be one of the contributions you make to the partnership. A rural western library worker says of working with a retired electrical engineer on a regular robotics program: “He kind of shies away from managing the kids and trying to keep their focus, but he does have the technical know-how. So, between both of us, we're able to keep the kids somewhat engaged.”</td></tr>
