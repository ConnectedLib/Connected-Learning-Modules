While the benefits of mentoring may be visible to you, how can you tell if youth themselves are open to working with mentors?   

### Youth signaling

Teens and tweens may not directly verbalize that they are seeking support. The concept of “youth signaling” describes the actions that youth undertake that may show signs of their motivation to learn. Examples of youth signaling include: sharing accomplishments, reaching out for guidance, openly displaying expertise, and actively networking.<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> These "signals" may indicate that a young person is open to mentoring.

For effective mentoring, it’s important to understand how the experience will affect youth and how to foster a meaningful relationship. Mentors and youth should develop a connection that is established by trust, friendship, and empathy.<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> Past research has identified some key characteristics and approaches to effective mentoring (for formal and informal situations), including: 
- **Talking with youth instead of at them**. Many mentors describe their approach to talking with youth as low-key or an equitable style of conversation.<sup><a name="3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> 
- **Offering encouragement and role modeling**. Through working together, youth and mentors can problem-solve and collaborate. Mentors share their skills, knowledge, expertise.<sup><a name="7" href="#fn7">7</a>, <a name="8" href="#fn8">8</a></sup>
- **Providing connections to other communities and experiences**. Mentors may offer pathways and contacts that can increase a young person’s personal and professional networks.<sup><a name="3" href="#fn3">3</a>, <a name="4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
- **Putting in the time**. For longer term situations, research shows that mentors and youth who spend time together on a consistent basis over long periods of time can create lasting bonds.<sup><a name="5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup>

### More formalized mentoring programs may require some additional planning 

Research on how to encourage effective, long term mentoring places emphasis on the following elements: 
- Time commitment from both mentor/mentee 
- Continuous training and support for mentors 
- Regular check ins with mentors and mentees 
- Community service projects 
- Structured activities and goal setting<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
- Program-sponsored activities to enhance mentoring 
- Parental support and involvement 
- Support from programs and services to supplement mentoring<sup><a name="6" href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
