Libraries have a longstanding tradition of providing youth with access to adult and community mentors. These experiences can help youth with employment efforts, technology training, and career development.<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>  The first step is often identifying a potential community partner. Youth are often the ones to first approach adults as potential mentors and helping to facilitate that relationship may be a first step.

A few organizations that can help identify adult mentors and volunteers include:
