The following section outlines some common challenges and ways to prepare for and overcome them:

### Facilitating the use of emerging technology. 

In working with emerging technology, youth librarians who are uncertain about their skills might want to partner with someone who can complement their background. 

INTK-001 offers this advice : “….it works better when you can have multiple mentors that can be there so when the students do get stuck, they have someone they can ask. And I'm very comfortable with a lot of this technology, but many of other programming staff aren't as comfortable as I am. “ (INTK-001) 

Braun and Vissner’s (2017) Ready to Code report outlines case studies of librarians who, even without formal technology backgrounds, have facilitated “computer science, coding, and computational thinking skills” programming and events. For example, librarians can provide teens with the resources they need to develop their own STEM focused programming such as computing and coding clubs. 

### Assisting mentors who haven’t worked with youth or served in a leadership capacity 

At times, a potential mentor may be intimidated or unsure about the "right" approach to working with teens. In these situations, a few approaches may help, such as: 

Be the facilitator in expert-led programming to help increase the mentor's level of comfort (Shannon L. interview, 2017) 

For interns or youth as mentors, allow them to practice and ask questions about how to lead and coach (Kitsap Regional Library, Make. Do. Share., 2017 beta). 

Provide support in the mentor's planning activities, workshops, or events. For example, allow the mentor to build the content or curriculum and then offer suggestions for making it work with a teen audience. For example, you could let them know when they should add breaks into the schedule(Shannon L. interview 4-7-17) 

### Dealing with the impermanence of mentoring relationships 

A process for the closure of longer term mentoring relationships may be evaluated early on in the planning. Certain youth may be affected by an abrupt closure (DuBois & Karcher, 2013). Here are a few ways to prepare for and close out a mentoring experience: 

Raise the issue of closure early on to introduce endings as a normal phase of the mentoring process (DuBois & Karcher, 2013). 

Set clear guidelines for mentors on their expectations after the mentoring program ends 

When appropriate, offer ways for youth to stay in touch with mentors 

Create a plan for closure if mentors leave or the relationship needs to end 

Research suggests providing closure or “ending rituals” or activities to reflect on the end of the relationship can provide youth with growth and learning opportunities (DuBois & Karcher, 2013). 

Closure plan can include a way for youth and mentors to say goodbye and ask youth reflective questions (e.g., What did you like best about the experience?)
