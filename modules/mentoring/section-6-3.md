A process for the closure of longer term mentoring relationships may be evaluated early on in the planning. Certain youth may be affected by an abrupt closure.<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
Here are a few ways to prepare for and close out a mentoring experience: 

- Raise the issue of closure early on to introduce endings as a normal phase of the mentoring process<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
- Set clear guidelines for mentors on their expectations after the mentoring program ends 
- When appropriate, offer ways for youth to stay in touch with mentors 
- Create a plan for closure if mentors leave or the relationship needs to end 
- Research suggests providing closure or “ending rituals” or activities to reflect on the end of the relationship can provide youth with growth and learning opportunities<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
- Your closure plan can include a way for youth and mentors to say goodbye and ask youth reflective questions (e.g., What did you like best about the experience?)
