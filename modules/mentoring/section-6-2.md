At times, a potential mentor may be intimidated or unsure about the "right" approach to working with teens. In these situations, a few different approaches may help.

- **Be the facilitator** in expert-led programming to help increase the mentor's level of comfort<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
- For interns or youth as mentors, **allow them to practice and ask questions** about how to lead and coach<sup><a name="2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> 
- **Provide support** in the mentor's planning activities, workshops, or events. For example, allow the mentor to build the content or curriculum and then offer suggestions for making it work with a teen audience. For example, you could let them know when they should add breaks into the schedule<sup><a name="1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
