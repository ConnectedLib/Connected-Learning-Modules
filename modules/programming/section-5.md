## The 21st Century Library

- YALSA’s [**Teen Programming HQ**](http://hq.yalsa.net/) and _School Library Journal_’s [**Teen Librarian Toolbox**](http://www.teenlibrariantoolbox.com/) are full of ideas and examples of dynamic teen programs.
- [**The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action**](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report) and YALSA’s [**Teen Programming Guidelines**](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/teen-programming-guidelines) should be required reading for today’s teen services librarians.
- The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) funded many early library learning labs, which you can read about in [**Learning Labs in Libraries and Museums: Transformative Spaces for Teens**](https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/1/AssetManager/LearningLabsReport.pdf).
- YALSA recently revised the [**Teen Services Competencies for Library Staff**](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/guidelines/yacompetencies) to reflect the changing role of libraries in teens’ lives. 

## Program Design

- [**Project Outcome**](https://www.projectoutcome.org/) hosts a wealth of information, advice, and resources for developing, measuring and reporting outcomes specifically in a public library setting.
- A 2015 article from _Library Journal_ titled [**Outcomes, Impacts, and Indicators**](https://lj.libraryjournal.com/2015/09/managing-libraries/outcomes-impacts-and-indicators/) provides an in-depth look at developing program outcomes in a library.
- DIY Learn has created a [**free, two-hour online class**](http://www.open.edu/openlearncreate/course/view.php?id=2214) devoted exclusively to understanding and developing a theory of change. 
- YALSA provides sample learning outcomes in several different categories in [Teens First: Basic Learning Outcomes](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/sites/ala.org.yalsa/files/content/Teens%20First_%20Basic%20Learning%20Outcomes%20Guide.pdf).
