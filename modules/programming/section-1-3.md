- YALSA’s [**Teen Programming HQ**](http://hq.yalsa.net/) and _School Library Journal_’s [**Teen Librarian Toolbox**](http://www.teenlibrariantoolbox.com/) are full of ideas and examples of dynamic teen programs.
- [**The Future of Library Services For and With Teens: A Call to Action**](http://www.ala.org/yaforum/future-library-services-and-teens-project-report) and YALSA’s [**Teen Programming Guidelines**](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/teen-programming-guidelines) should be required reading for today’s teen services librarians.
- The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) funded many early library learning labs, which you can read about in [**Learning Labs in Libraries and Museums: Transformative Spaces for Teens**](https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/1/AssetManager/LearningLabsReport.pdf).
- YALSA recently revised the [**Teen Services Competencies for Library Staff**](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/guidelines/yacompetencies) to reflect the changing role of libraries in teens’ lives.
