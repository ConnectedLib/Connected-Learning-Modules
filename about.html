<h1>Our Project</h1>
<p>The Con­nect­edLib Toolkit was created to help librar­i­ans incor­po­rate dig­i­tal media into their work with youth to pro­mote con­nec­tions across learn­ing con­texts. Fac­ulty mem­bers from the library and infor­ma­tion sci­ence (LIS) schools at the Uni­ver­sity of Wash­ing­ton and Uni­ver­sity of Mary­land teamed with pub­lic libraries to cre­ate this pro­fes­sional devel­op­ment resource that sup­ports librar­i­ans in their efforts to lever­age new media tech­nolo­gies and pro­mote youth’s con­nected learn­ing expe­ri­ences in libraries. Our pub­lic library part­ners — <a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank">Prov­i­dence Pub­lic Library</a>, <a href="http://www.spl.org/" target="_blank">Seat­tle Pub­lic Library</a>, and <a href="http://www.krl.org/" target="_blank">Kit­sap Regional Library</a> — serve a vari­ety of tra­di­tion­ally under­served youth pop­u­la­tions, includ­ing rural, immi­grant, and low-income youth.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://clrn.dmlhub.net/publications/connected-learning-an-agenda-for-research-and-design" target="_blank">con­nected learn­ing model</a> artic­u­lated by Mimi Ito and col­leagues describes how net­worked tech­nolo­gies can be lever­aged in a vari­ety of settings—including libraries—to pro­mote learn­ing expe­ri­ences that are interest-driven, peer-supported, academically-oriented, and con­nected to the var­i­ous con­texts that young peo­ple expe­ri­ence in their every­day lives. Con­nect­edLib responds directly to this need by work­ing with in-service librar­i­ans to cre­ate a suite of pro­fes­sional devel­op­ment resources aimed at build­ing librar­i­ans’ capac­ity to engage and pro­mote con­nected learn­ing and 21st cen­tury skills among today’s dig­i­tal youth.</p>
