        Partnerships can be a way to introduce new youth to the library when your partner brings their existing audiences to you.</p> <ul><li>A suburban library in the midwest held STEAM programming for the local Boy Scout troop, bringing all the scouts in the library, along with some parents and siblings. </li>
<li>Another libraryâ€™s partnership with a high school e-sports club often brought new teens into the library.</li>
<li>Many libraries partner with Parks and Recreation departments--sometimes even sharing facilities--to bring in the Parks and Rec visitors to the library.</li></ul>
